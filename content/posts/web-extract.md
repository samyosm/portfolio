In our web service, we can fill the prompt and generate image with one of the
text-to-image worker AI model randomly.

And our techniques are as follows:

Front-end: The index.html is the main page to let users input their prompts and
see generated image. Back-end: The extract.php is the main PHP program to handle
user prompt and respond generated image.
