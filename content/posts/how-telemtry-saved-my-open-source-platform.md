What started as a frustration with not being able to get in touch with our
users, quickly developed into a redesign of the flow of our platform.

My team and I are developing an open-source platform that helps developers
deploy and manage their applications in Kubernetes. We have been working hard to
expand our user base, and the efforts were starting to show results.

The rising number of installations was satisfying to see. However, that was the
only thing we were able to observe. We wanted to know more. We wanted to know
what users are doing with our platform and what they are struggling with.

The following short story could be considered a #building-in-public entry of our
startup, but I just found it interesting and wanted to share it with you.
