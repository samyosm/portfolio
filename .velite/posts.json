    "content": "<p>Linus Benedict Torvalds is born on the 28th of December 1969 in Helsinki,\nFinland to a educated and wealthy family of journalists. This means he grows up\nin tech-savvy environment that sparks his interest in computers. At this point\nin time, he has no idea this interest in technology would change the tech world\nfor ever.</p>\n<p>First lines of code in basic:</p>\n<pre><code>10 PRINT \"SARA IS THE BEST\"\n20 GOTO 10\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Education</h2>\n<p>From this interest, he goes to the University of Helsinki for a Master’s degree\nin computer science. This allows him to hone his programming skills and teach\nhim about operating systems. A year after starting university, however, he joins\nthe Finnish navy for his mandatory military service.</p>\n<h2>Linux beginning</h2>\n<p>At this point, Linus Torvalds started using MS-DOS (Microsoft’s OS) but\npreferred using UNIX (IBM’s OS). He was frustrated with their limitations, so he\nstarted working on a new operating system as a small side project. Unbeknownst\nto him, this side project would come to power 96.3% of the Internet 20 years\nlater.</p>\n<h2>Linux community</h2>\n<p>With time, the development of Linux became more than one man can handle. The\nproject was therefore made open for development by anyone willing to contribute;\nthat is, it became open source. To Linus’ surprise, a lot of people came to use\nand contribute to Linux. Which greatly hastened the release of Linux 1.0.</p>\n<p>At the start, Linus was afraid of commercial use of his work so it was actually\nforbidden. It is only after hearing a speech by Richard Stallman on the nature\nof free and open source software that Linus was moved to use the GPLv2 license.</p>\n<h2>Git</h2>\n<p>The sheer amount of Linux contributions were becoming hard to manage. As such,\nLinus created Git, a version control software (VCS). There again, he created\nsomething of immense importance without realizing it.</p>\n<p>Git is used by all Fortune 500 companies and almost all software you can think\nof. They have over 90% market share of version control software. If you’ve once\nworked as a developers, you have most likely used Git.</p>\n<h2>Today</h2>\n<p>By 2006, Linus became much more of a community project rather than Linus’ work.\nIndeed, less that 2% of Linus code was was written by Linus himself. Now days,\nwe can expect the number to be near 0. Still, to this day, he is an active\nmaintainer of Linux repository and continues to contribute.</p>\n<h2>Fun Fact: Beef with Nvidia</h2>\n<p>In 2012, he participated to a Q&#x26;A where people asked him questions about Linux.\nSomewhere in the interview, he begins to talk about how hard Nvidia was to work\nwith; especially with their close-sourced code. However, it quickly got the\npoint where he says \"Nvidia FUCK YOU!\" before giving the middle finger.</p>",
